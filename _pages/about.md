I am a AI research graduate student based in GIST DS Lab, South Korea. I am interested in philosophic designs of AI foundations. My research goal is to build an AGI model that is domain-agnostic, conscious, self-driven. I am interested in designing internal representations for an agent manipulate as the building block of their reasoning. 

I am also interested in designing consciousness of an agent. I am aiming to give self-directedness (or urge) that fuels and navigates their reasoning streams.
